# Theme_Park_Manager
This is a project I made in Java. I also used JavaFX Scene Builder 2.
It has a few bugs but for my first full java project I am happy with it.
To use it just download the Theme Park Manager.exe file
If it doesn't luanch you may need to download [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)

## How to use
Once the program is running you will have to click on the 'New' button.
Click 'No' on the following prompt. Follow the prompts. If a prompt keeps 
coming up you may need to enter in a number. To view the Employees, Guests, 
and Rides you will have to click on their respective button for the list 
view to update.
